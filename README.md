### Hi there :sunglasses:ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcelo Ribeiro. I am post graduate in Biology.:microscope: I started studying programming on my own (End of the year 2020) because I always liked the technology area. I got discouraged and came back with everything. How lucky I am (not to say the opposite) I lost everything I had done. Once again I got discouraged...But I got to know Git and Github and now I don't intend to stop.

I am a person who is always learning and looking to improve in what I already do. I'm already almost a Junior Fullstack, constantly improving my knowledge. :relieved: :battery:
ðŸ”­ I'm currently studying backend and will update my profile soon. :wink:
